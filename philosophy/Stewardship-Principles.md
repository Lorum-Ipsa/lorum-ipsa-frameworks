# Stewardship Principles

## Introduction

Stewardship is the careful and responsible management of resources entrusted to us. Whether managing data, systems, relationships, or knowledge, we approach our work with a steward's mindset—recognizing that we are caretakers, not just users.

## Core Values

### Responsibility
We accept accountability for the resources under our care and make decisions that benefit both current and future stakeholders.

### Sustainability
We manage resources in ways that ensure their availability and health for the long term, avoiding short-term gains that compromise future viability.

### Transparency
We operate openly, documenting our decisions and processes so others can understand and build upon our work.

### Service
We recognize that stewardship is ultimately about serving others—our users, our communities, and those who will come after us.

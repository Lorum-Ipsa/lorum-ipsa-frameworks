# Security-First Digital Publishing Standard  
## Version 1.0  
Lorum Ipsa Public Framework

---

## 1. Purpose

The Security-First Digital Publishing Standard defines minimum structural and operational requirements for secure, durable, and author-owned digital publishing environments.

This standard establishes baseline expectations for:

- Infrastructure stability  
- Access control discipline  
- Change management  
- Monitoring and oversight  
- Documentation governance  

It is intended as a framework reference, not a complete security manual.

---

## 2. Scope

This standard applies to:

- Author-owned websites  
- Structured digital publishing environments  
- Multi-tenant publishing systems  
- Managed hosting environments  
- Long-form digital bodies of work  

It does not replace formal security audits, legal compliance requirements, or regulatory obligations.

---

## 3. Core Security Principles

### 3.1 Infrastructure Ownership

Publishing infrastructure must ensure:

- Domain ownership clarity  
- Hosting portability  
- Content export capability  
- Migration feasibility  

Dependency without reversibility is non-compliant with this standard.

---

### 3.2 Hardened Baseline Configuration

Every deployment must establish:

- Least-privilege access controls  
- Defined user roles and permissions  
- Secure credential handling procedures  
- Default-deny administrative posture  

Baseline configuration must be documented before launch.

---

### 3.3 Controlled Access Management

Access governance must include:

- Role-based permission assignment  
- Periodic access review cycles  
- Revocation procedures for departed users  
- Multi-factor authentication where supported  

Administrative authority must be explicitly defined.

---

### 3.4 Change Management Discipline

All material system changes must include:

- Change documentation  
- Configuration version reference  
- Rollback feasibility assessment  
- Risk evaluation  

Untracked configuration drift violates this standard.

---

### 3.5 Monitoring and Logging

Systems must support:

- Administrative activity logging  
- Authentication event tracking  
- Update/change records  
- Error and anomaly visibility  

Monitoring must be proportionate to system complexity.

---

### 3.6 Update and Patch Governance

Publishing systems must implement:

- Defined update cadence  
- Dependency review before major upgrades  
- Controlled staging or validation process  
- Post-update verification procedures  

Updates must not compromise system integrity.

---

### 3.7 Data Protection Awareness

Systems must:

- Define data sensitivity categories  
- Minimize data collection where possible  
- Clarify retention expectations  
- Limit unnecessary third-party exposure  

This standard emphasizes structural risk reduction rather than regulatory compliance detail.

---

### 3.8 Documentation Integrity

Every managed environment must maintain:

- System configuration records  
- Access inventory  
- Security baseline notes  
- Change logs  

Documentation is considered a security control.

---

## 4. Risk Separation Model

Security architecture must maintain separation between:

- Publishing infrastructure  
- Economic or token systems  
- External integration modules  

No economic or incentive layer may compromise structural stability.

Risk domains must be clearly defined and documented.

---

## 5. Stewardship Requirements

Security-first publishing requires:

- Periodic review cycles  
- Capacity discipline  
- Explicit responsibility assignment  
- Defined escalation pathways  

Security is treated as a continuous operational posture.

---

## 6. Non-Compliance Indicators

A publishing system is non-compliant with this standard if it:

- Lacks documented access roles  
- Cannot be migrated or exported  
- Has no update discipline  
- Maintains undocumented configuration changes  
- Grants broad administrative access without audit visibility  

---

## 7. Governance Model

This standard assumes:

- Centralized security policy authority  
- Explicit responsibility allocation  
- Clear scope boundaries  
- Defined risk acceptance thresholds  

Governance maturity may expand over time but must not precede stability.

---

## 8. Versioning

Version: 1.0  
Release Type: Foundational Baseline  
Status: Public Framework  

Future revisions may expand or refine requirements.

---

## 9. Disclaimer

This standard is provided as a structural reference framework.

It does not:

- Guarantee security  
- Replace professional audits  
- Constitute legal advice  
- Satisfy regulatory compliance by default  

Adaptation to specific environments is required.

---

## 10. Closing Principle

Security is not a feature.

Security is a posture.

Digital publishing environments that treat infrastructure casually accumulate fragility.

Security-first systems prioritize:

- Stability before scale  
- Documentation before expansion  
- Discipline before experimentation  

Durability is the objective.

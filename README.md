# Lorum Ipsa Frameworks  
**Security-First Digital Publishing Standards**

Lorum Ipsa Frameworks is the public governance and operational template layer of Lorum Ipsa — a security-first digital publishing and stewardship practice.

This repository contains structured templates and reference documents used to support durable, author-owned digital infrastructure.

It is not an internal operations repository.  
It is a public standards layer.

## Philosophy

Lorum Ipsa operates under a single principle:

> Publishing is a craft.

That means:

- Structure enables clarity  
- Security is a form of care  
- Ownership prevents dependency  
- Stewardship outlasts trends  

These templates reflect that philosophy.

## What This Repository Contains

This repository includes:

- Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) template  
- Governance structure template  
- Risk register template  
- Security baseline checklist  
- Client onboarding checklist  
- Documentation standards  

These are framework-level documents designed for adaptation and educational use.

They demonstrate how digital publishing infrastructure can be governed with discipline rather than improvisation.

## What This Repository Does Not Contain

For security and client confidentiality reasons, this repository does **not** include:

- Client-specific workflows  
- Internal security configurations  
- Infrastructure thresholds  
- Incident response specifics  
- Credential handling procedures  
- Revenue-sensitive models  

Operational details remain internal.

This repository exists to communicate standards — not to expose systems.

## Intended Audience

This repository may be useful to:

- Independent publishing practices  
- Security-conscious web agencies  
- Author infrastructure builders  
- Digital property managers  
- Founders designing governance frameworks  
- CTO candidates evaluating system maturity  

It reflects a deliberate, documentation-first approach to infrastructure.

## Architectural Context

Lorum Ipsa forms Layer 1 of a broader structured infrastructure stack:

- **Layer 1:** Secure digital publishing & stewardship  
- **Layer 2:** Programmable incentive infrastructure (Kessari)  
- Future layers evolve only after structural stability  

Frameworks are documented before incentives are deployed.  
Governance precedes scale.

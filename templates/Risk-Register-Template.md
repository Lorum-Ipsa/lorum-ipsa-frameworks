# Risk Register Template  
Lorum Ipsa – Public Governance Framework

---

## Purpose

This template defines a structured method for identifying, documenting, evaluating, and monitoring risks within a digital publishing environment.

A risk register:

- Makes exposure visible  
- Prevents silent accumulation of fragility  
- Clarifies ownership  
- Enables disciplined mitigation  

Undocumented risk is unmanaged risk.

---

## Risk Classification Categories

Risks may be categorized under one or more of the following domains:

- Operational  
- Security  
- Financial  
- Legal  
- Infrastructure  
- Governance  
- Reputational  
- Integration / External Dependency  

Categories help structure analysis but do not limit identification.

## Risk Register Table

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Category | Likelihood (Low/Med/High) | Impact (Low/Med/High) | Risk Rating | Mitigation Strategy | Owner | Status | Review Date |
|----------|------------------|----------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------|--------------------|--------|--------|------------|

## Field Definitions

### Risk ID
Unique identifier (e.g., RISK-001).

### Risk Description
Clear, concise statement of the risk condition.

Avoid vague language.

Example format:
> "If [condition], then [negative consequence]."

---

### Category
Primary risk domain.

Multiple domains may be referenced in documentation notes.

---

### Likelihood
Estimated probability of occurrence:

- Low – Rare or unlikely  
- Medium – Possible under certain conditions  
- High – Expected or recurring  

---

### Impact
Estimated severity if realized:

- Low – Minor disruption  
- Medium – Moderate operational or reputational damage  
- High – Material operational, financial, or security consequence  

---

### Risk Rating
Derived from Likelihood × Impact.

May be represented as:

- Low  
- Moderate  
- Elevated  
- Critical  

Organizations may define scoring matrices separately.

---

### Mitigation Strategy
Defined response plan, such as:

- Preventative control  
- Monitoring control  
- Process change  
- Capacity adjustment  
- Insurance or transfer  
- Acceptance (documented risk acceptance required)  

Mitigation must be specific, not aspirational.

---

### Owner
Role responsible for monitoring and managing the risk.

Responsibility must be explicit.

---

### Status
Indicates current posture:

- Identified  
- Mitigating  
- Monitoring  
- Accepted  
- Closed  

---

### Review Date
Scheduled reassessment date.

Risk registers must be reviewed periodically.

---

## Risk Evaluation Guidelines

Risk assessment should consider:

- Single points of failure  
- Access control exposure  
- External platform dependency  
- Undocumented configuration changes  
- Capacity overload  
- Legal ambiguity  
- Economic instability  
- Integration complexity  

Structural stability precedes expansion.

---

## Escalation Triggers

Escalation should occur when:

- Risk rating becomes Elevated or Critical  
- Mitigation fails or degrades  
- Multiple related risks compound  
- Governance boundaries are unclear  
- External dependencies materially change  

Escalation authority must be predefined.

---

## Review Cadence

Recommended review intervals:

- Quarterly for stable environments  
- Monthly for new deployments  
- Immediate review following material incidents  
- Upon major architectural change  

Stagnant registers create false security.

---

## Risk Acceptance Policy

Risks may be accepted only if:

- Explicitly documented  
- Owner assigned  
- Impact understood  
- Reassessment date defined  

Implicit acceptance is not permitted.

---

## Non-Compliance Indicators

A risk governance framework is insufficient if:

- Risks are undocumented  
- Owners are undefined  
- Review dates are absent  
- Mitigation language is vague  
- Risk acceptance is informal  

---

## Closing Principle

Risk cannot be eliminated.

Risk can be:

- Identified  
- Measured  
- Constrained  
- Monitored  

Disciplined risk governance preserves durability.

Unacknowledged risk compounds silently.

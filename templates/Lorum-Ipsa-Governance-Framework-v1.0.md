# Lorum Ipsa Governance Framework  
## Version 1.0  
Security-First Digital Publishing Infrastructure

---

## 1. Purpose

The Lorum Ipsa Governance Framework defines the structural, security, and stewardship principles that guide managed digital publishing environments.

This framework establishes:

- Operational discipline  
- Security baseline standards  
- Risk governance structure  
- Authority allocation clarity  
- Documentation requirements  

It exists to ensure durability over velocity.

---

## 2. Foundational Doctrine

This framework rests on two core doctrines:

### Publishing as a Craft
Publishing is deliberate preparation for longevity.

It prioritizes:

- Structure  
- Ownership  
- Stability  
- Security  
- Clarity  

Distribution is secondary to durability.

---

### Stewardship as an Operational Posture
Stewardship is structured continuity.

It assumes:

- Infrastructure requires oversight  
- Change must be controlled  
- Documentation prevents drift  
- Security must be ongoing  

Launch is the beginning of stewardship, not its conclusion.

---

## 3. Governance Objectives

The framework aims to:

- Prevent unmanaged fragility  
- Define authority boundaries  
- Reduce operational ambiguity  
- Maintain security posture  
- Separate risk domains  
- Preserve portability and reversibility  

Durable systems require defined structure.

---

## 4. Core Governance Layers

### Layer 1 — Infrastructure Stability

Ensures:

- Domain ownership clarity  
- Hosting portability  
- Controlled configuration  
- Documented architecture  

Stability precedes expansion.

---

### Layer 2 — Security Discipline

Enforces:

- Access control governance  
- Least-privilege principles  
- Monitoring and logging visibility  
- Update cadence discipline  
- Risk documentation  

Security is a posture, not a feature.

---

### Layer 3 — Risk Governance

Maintains:

- Documented risk register  
- Defined mitigation ownership  
- Explicit risk acceptance  
- Escalation pathways  
- Periodic review cycles  

Unacknowledged risk compounds silently.

---

### Layer 4 — Authority & Decision Clarity

Defines:

- Responsible roles  
- Accountable authority  
- Escalation boundaries  
- Review cadence  

Undefined authority creates instability.

---

## 5. Operational Standards Referenced

This framework incorporates and aligns with:

- Publishing-As-Craft.md  
- Stewardship-Principles.md  
- Security-First-Digital-Publishing-Standard-v1.0.md  
- Client-Onboarding-Checklist.md  
- Risk-Register-Template.md  
- Security-Baseline-Checklist.md  
- Governance-Matrix-Template.md  

Each document supports a specific control domain.

---

## 6. Risk Separation Model

The framework enforces separation between:

- Publishing infrastructure  
- Security governance  
- Economic/token systems (if applicable)  
- External integrations  

Structural stability must not depend on economic experimentation.

Risk domains must remain distinct.

---

## 7. Change Management Principles

All material changes must:

- Be documented  
- Have defined authority  
- Include rollback consideration  
- Be logged  
- Be reviewed  

Uncontrolled iteration increases fragility.

---

## 8. Review Cadence

The framework requires periodic review:

- Quarterly governance review  
- Baseline reassessment after structural changes  
- Immediate reassessment after security incidents  
- Role review upon authority shifts  

Governance without review decays.

---

## 9. Capacity Discipline

Sustainable governance requires:

- Defined workload limits  
- Controlled client intake  
- Explicit review intervals  
- Attention allocation proportional to system complexity  

Overextension undermines security posture.

---

## 10. Compliance Boundaries

This framework:

- Is structural in nature  
- Does not replace formal security audits  
- Does not constitute legal advice  
- Does not guarantee regulatory compliance  

Adaptation to specific environments is required.

---

## 11. Non-Compliance Indicators

A publishing environment is non-aligned with this framework if:

- Authority is undocumented  
- Access control is informal  
- Risk register is absent  
- Change management is reactive  
- Infrastructure portability is unclear  
- Review cadence is undefined  

Governance gaps create instability.

---

## 12. Versioning & Maturity

Version: 1.0  
Release Type: Foundational Baseline  
Status: Public Framework  

Future revisions may:

- Refine authority structures  
- Expand risk modeling guidance  
- Introduce maturity tiers  

Governance evolves after stability.

---

## 13. Closing Principle

Durable digital publishing requires:

- Structure before scale  
- Security before exposure  
- Documentation before delegation  
- Governance before expansion  

Infrastructure treated casually becomes fragile.

Infrastructure governed deliberately becomes durable.

Stability is the objective.

# Governance Matrix Template  
Lorum Ipsa – Public Framework Reference

---

## Purpose

This template defines a structured method for assigning authority, responsibility, and escalation pathways within a digital publishing environment.

A governance matrix:

- Clarifies decision rights  
- Prevents silent authority gaps  
- Reduces operational ambiguity  
- Defines accountability boundaries  

Undefined authority creates unmanaged risk.

---

## Governance Model Overview

Governance must define:

- Who decides  
- Who executes  
- Who reviews  
- Who escalates  
- Who accepts risk  

Authority without documentation is instability.

---

## RACI Model Reference

This template may use the RACI framework:

- **R – Responsible:** Executes the task  
- **A – Accountable:** Owns final decision authority  
- **C – Consulted:** Provides input before decision  
- **I – Informed:** Notified after decision  

Each governance action must have one clearly defined Accountable role.

## Governance Matrix Table

| Function / Decision Area | Responsible | Accountable | Consulted | Informed | Escalation Authority | Review Cadence |
|---------------------------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|----------------|

## Example Governance Domains

The following domains should be defined for any managed publishing environment:

### 1. Infrastructure Governance
- Hosting provider selection  
- Domain management  
- DNS authority  
- System architecture decisions  

---

### 2. Security Governance
- Security policy definition  
- Access control approval  
- Incident response authority  
- Risk acceptance decisions  
- Monitoring oversight  

Security authority must be explicit and centralized where appropriate.

---

### 3. Change Management
- Feature deployment approval  
- Configuration modification authority  
- Update scheduling  
- Rollback decision authority  

Unapproved changes violate governance discipline.

---

### 4. Economic / Integration Governance (If Applicable)
- Token integration approval  
- External API connections  
- Payment processing integration  
- Wallet connectivity modules  

Risk domains must remain separated.

---

### 5. Client Communication Governance
- Scope changes  
- Pricing modifications  
- Service tier adjustments  
- Escalation procedures  

Client-facing authority must be clearly defined.

---

### 6. Documentation Governance
- SOP approval  
- Change log validation  
- Risk register updates  
- Review schedule enforcement  

Documentation discipline is a governance function.

---

## Escalation Pathways

Escalation triggers should be defined for:

- Elevated or critical risks  
- Security incidents  
- Policy violations  
- Unclear authority boundaries  
- Capacity overload  

Escalation authority must be pre-assigned.

---

## Review Cadence

Governance matrices should be reviewed:

- Quarterly in stable environments  
- Following structural changes  
- After security incidents  
- When authority shifts occur  

Governance drift increases systemic fragility.

---

## Separation of Risk Domains

Governance must maintain separation between:

- Publishing infrastructure  
- Security authority  
- Economic/token systems  
- External integrations  

Cross-domain authority must be intentional and documented.

---

## Non-Compliance Indicators

Governance is insufficient if:

- Accountable role is undefined  
- Escalation authority is unclear  
- Security authority is fragmented  
- Decision rights are assumed rather than documented  
- Review cadence is absent  

---

## Closing Principle

Governance is structural clarity.

Clear authority prevents instability.  
Defined accountability reduces conflict.  
Documented escalation preserves coherence.

Durable systems are governed systems.

# Client Onboarding Checklist  
Lorum Ipsa – Public Framework Reference

---

## Purpose

This checklist defines the structured onboarding process for establishing a secure, stewarded digital publishing environment.

It ensures:

- Controlled access transition  
- Infrastructure clarity  
- Security baseline establishment  
- Scope alignment  
- Documentation completeness  

This is a governance checklist, not a step-by-step internal procedure.

---

## 1. Pre-Onboarding Confirmation

Before onboarding begins:

- [ ] Service tier confirmed (Foundation / Craft / Stewardship)
- [ ] Scope of services documented
- [ ] Pricing and payment structure agreed
- [ ] Terms of Service accepted
- [ ] Privacy and data handling expectations clarified
- [ ] Communication channel defined
- [ ] Primary decision-maker identified

---

## 2. Domain & Infrastructure Verification

- [ ] Domain ownership verified
- [ ] Registrar access clarified
- [ ] Hosting arrangement confirmed (new or existing)
- [ ] DNS authority identified
- [ ] Migration requirements assessed (if applicable)
- [ ] Content export feasibility reviewed

Ownership clarity precedes deployment.

---

## 3. Secure Access Collection

Access must be gathered using structured and secure exchange methods.

- [ ] Administrative accounts identified
- [ ] Role-based access mapped
- [ ] Least-privilege model applied
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication enabled where supported
- [ ] Legacy accounts identified for review or removal
- [ ] Access inventory documented

No shared credentials without documentation.

---

## 4. Content & Structure Intake

- [ ] Existing content inventory collected
- [ ] Content classification completed
- [ ] Navigation structure drafted
- [ ] Gated content strategy defined (if applicable)
- [ ] Editorial hierarchy reviewed
- [ ] Archival material identified

Structure precedes visual refinement.

---

## 5. Security Baseline Establishment

- [ ] Baseline configuration documented
- [ ] Access permissions validated
- [ ] Logging capability confirmed
- [ ] Update cadence defined
- [ ] Monitoring approach clarified
- [ ] Backup and recovery expectations outlined

Security posture must be defined before launch.

---

## 6. Risk & Responsibility Alignment

- [ ] Scope of security responsibility documented
- [ ] Economic or external integrations reviewed
- [ ] Escalation pathway defined
- [ ] Incident reporting expectations clarified
- [ ] Change management boundaries agreed

Undefined boundaries create unmanaged risk.

---

## 7. Deployment Planning

- [ ] Timeline confirmed
- [ ] Staging or validation process defined
- [ ] Rollback feasibility considered
- [ ] Client review milestones scheduled
- [ ] Launch criteria defined

Launch is a controlled transition, not an event.

---

## 8. Documentation & Records

- [ ] System configuration recorded
- [ ] Access registry finalized
- [ ] Service tier recorded
- [ ] Review cadence scheduled
- [ ] Change log initiated

Documentation is considered part of the security posture.

---

## 9. Post-Launch Stewardship Activation

- [ ] Monitoring schedule initiated
- [ ] Review interval scheduled
- [ ] Update governance active
- [ ] Client communication cadence confirmed

Stewardship begins after launch — not before it ends.

---

## Non-Compliance Indicators

Onboarding is incomplete if:

- Ownership is unclear
- Access roles are undocumented
- Security baseline is undefined
- Scope boundaries are ambiguous
- No documentation record exists

---

## Closing Principle

Onboarding is not account creation.

Onboarding is controlled transition into a stewarded publishing environment.

Clarity precedes deployment.  
Documentation precedes authority.  
Security precedes exposure.
